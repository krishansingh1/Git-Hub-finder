# Git-Hub Finder 

This is one of my favorite pojects. In this app we can search git hub users by username and its give us their profile, and various other info it will give us a list of their repositories links to them. This app is based on github api, I fetch github api using async await and deploy it into this application. I used bootswatch in this app which is a free bootstrap themes library to create better UI.
